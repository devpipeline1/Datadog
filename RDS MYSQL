To interact with an Amazon RDS MySQL database from your client server, you'll need to follow a few key steps—from setup to execution. Here's a complete walkthrough:

Step 1: Create an RDS MySQL Instance
You can do this via the AWS Console:
- Log in to AWS Console and go to RDS.
- Click Create database.
- Choose MySQL as the engine.
- Select a template (e.g., Free Tier).
- Set DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
- Under Connectivity, make sure to:
- Enable public access if you want to connect from outside the VPC.
- Choose the correct VPC security group.
- Click Create database and wait for it to become available.

Step 2: Create a Database and User
Once your RDS instance is up, connect using a MySQL client from your server:
mysql -u masteruser -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -p
Then run:
-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE myapp_db;
-- Create a new user
CREATE USER 'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPassword123';
-- Grant privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myapp_db.* TO 'appuser'@'%';
-- Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Step 3: Connect from Your Client Server
Install MySQL client to access RDS endpoint 
sudo yum install mysql    #for redhat linux
sudo yum install mariadb  #for amazon linux

if its not working the please follow below steps

sudo dnf install wget -y
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm -y

sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023

sudo dnf install mysql-community-client -y
             or
sudo dnf install mysql-community-client --nogpgcheck -y

mysql --version

connect to the server
mysql -u appuser -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -p

Step 4: Run queries
USE myapp_db;

-- Example query
SELECT * FROM users;
